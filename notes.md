# Notes to Self

### Inputs

- User Settings work is setting up the inputs to be more functional
- Updating the Editable Form List to be more flexible for other submissions too
  - Perhaps this should be more abstract - the inner form component should do the un-wrapping of values and such.

### 12/30/23

- User Settings are starting to get hooked up!
- Determine new/existing and use PUT/POST for update/create.
- Update permissioning.

- Determine if the editable info list should post entire models, or if it should continually execute 'PATCH' requests

- Create a better shared repo-concept for more data-api hookups later.
